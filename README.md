# DynamicWebServer
## Computer Networks and Communications (Lab 4): Create a Dynamic Web Server
Write a program that listens on a TCP port specified at run time. When a connection is made, the server will send back an HTTP 200 response and HTML text, which when shown in a browser, will display:

"Your IP address is- " followed by the IP address of the machine that has connected. The IP address of the client may be obtained using the getInetAddress method in the Socket class.
